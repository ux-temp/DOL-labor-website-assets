DOL-labor-website-assets
========================


This is the assets project to the labor website

This project will contain the templates (php), styles and any other dependencies that should be made a common asset for use for the DOL website, minus the UX Framework.



####Installation

projects and any other pages dependent on the template should go into the folder /p
projects that have been declared a common asset and can be used as a common asset should go into /includes


This project must sit in the root of a domain for the templates to be linked correctly.
It is suggested that a virtual host is setup on a local WAMP environment and mapped to a folder, so the source is not polluted with other non-related projects.
